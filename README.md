With this application you can click a button from you computer device ( FindMobileServer --> https://github.com/tsoglani/FindMobileServer) 
and your android device will ring so you can find it (works via Wifi, so your mobile and computer device must to be connected to the same local network), if you press it twice the phone will stop ringing.
